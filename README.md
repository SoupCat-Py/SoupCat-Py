Hi 👋 <br />
I am Soup <br />

**I know these languages:** <br />
↳ Python <br />
↳ JavaScript <br />
  ↳ React
↳ HTML <br />
↳ CSS <br />

**NOTE:** <br />
If you see a `.DS_Store` file or anything that starts with `._`, you can get rid of it. <br />
It's just a macOS thing and is useless on other operating systems.
